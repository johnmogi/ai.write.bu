Character Development:
Adam, as the protagonist, should have a clear arc that shows his growth and change throughout the story. He is starting to explore a new reality and must come to terms with the fact that his dreams are no longer passive, but active, and that they are leading him somewhere. Lilith, as his radiant wife, can act as a guide and support for him during his journey. Althea, their new host, can also be a source of knowledge and wisdom, helping Adam understand the universe.

Pacing:
The story should start with a slower pace, establishing the characters and their situation. As Adam begins to have more active dreams, the pacing can pick up, leading to a climax in which he discovers the true nature of his dreams. The final dream can be slower and more introspective, giving the reader time to reflect on the journey Adam has been on.

Tone:
The tone of the story should be mysterious and otherworldly, reflecting the shamanic dream theme. There should be a sense of wonder and awe at the universe, mixed with a sense of danger as Adam navigates unknown realms. The tone can also be introspective, as Adam reflects on his journey and what it means.

Setting Description:
The setting should be described in vivid detail, both in the real world and in the dream world. The green sanctuary where Adam and Lilith find shelter can be a peaceful and idyllic place, while the inner realms can be more dangerous and unpredictable. The deep blue ocean can be described as both beautiful and terrifying, as Adam realizes he is exploring galaxies in space.

Conflict:
The conflict can come from Adam's struggle to understand his new reality and the danger that comes with exploring unknown realms. He may also face opposition from others who do not understand or believe in his experiences.

Themes:
The themes of the story can include the power of the imagination, the connection between the physical and spiritual worlds, and the nature of reality. The story can also explore the idea of rebirth and starting over, as Adam recovers from his coma and enters a new phase of his life.

Dialogue:
The dialogue should be natural and reflect the characters' personalities. Lilith and Althea can offer guidance and wisdom, while Adam's internal dialogue can reflect his growing understanding of the universe.

Plot Development:
The plot should be structured to reflect Adam's journey from confusion and uncertainty to a clearer understanding of his new reality. The dreams can become more active and intense as the story progresses, leading to the final revelation in the deep blue ocean. The story can also include twists and turns, as Adam encounters unexpected obstacles and revelations.
