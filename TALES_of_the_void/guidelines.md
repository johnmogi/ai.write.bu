plot:
this novel is a series of chapters, each representing a different color and chakra in combination with the 9 games from stepehn de ropp book - the master game + 2 additional colors- black and white gold.

the introductory part explores my trip in italy 15 years ago where I went on a solo trek in the direction of the european rainbow gathering.
after a long trek by foot i arrived to Tuscany where i began to play a black and white game with myself - exploring my self images of good and bad.
then after seeing that these sides gets interwined i proceeded to make this into a performance in a medieval italian festival - the solo performance wasn't a success by itself but i did notice that the white energy is very alien to our world.
then i arrived at the rainbow gathering naming myself angel to remind myself i aspire to do good.
long story short i tried to raise a big performance and failes.
an outsider approached the camp and handed out poisnouis mushroums and the italian army had to rescue peopole in the middle of the night.
then i was reappraoched to raise another show by an australien man named ben.
I accepted but felt very ill, so ill that at the day i had to retire to my tent at the outskirts of the festival, feeling sick and exhuasted.
then a voice hit the back of my head:
"why do you insist to bring the blind, black and white vision to the land of the colored children?"
it hit me like a jolt and with a new found uplift i stormed the camp, utilising my old system of announcers with multilingual support we quickly raised a parade that stormed the nearby town and made a huge spectacle with me directing the performance - at start just a circle of performers holding hand and singing inwards and soon the chakra color show was unleashed- each stage decipting a different energy and mood.
the performance ended in a circle of song outwards towards the viewers and it felt very powerfull.
the villagers gave us bread and wine and it had a great ending - i felt as if a great curse has been lifted.

i the proceeded in my travel to france, but I concluded that i need to write a novel from all of this - I also decided that the book I'm writing should change the world - but i guess it just came from a lack of motivation or more to the point a way to motivate myself.

regarding the actual book plot:
black gold - dreams and endless dark visions tell the tale that never was- the real birth of the cosmos or more to the point- the genesys that never took place since before the start there was an eternity of silence.
form that silence and darkness a man is gaining conscousness - that man is called adam - he has dreams upon dreams of self discovery where he finds out that the birth of the cosmos was not an explosion - not with a bang but iwth a whisper.
the birth of the cosmos is also his birth into his own body.
