Keep the story moving at a steady pace, with a good balance of action and character-driven moments. Make sure the pacing is appropriate for the story's genre (action-adventure).
Use shorter chapters or cliffhangers at the end of chapters to keep readers engaged and eager to continue reading.
Tone:

The tone should be dark and gritty, reflecting the dangerous and seedy world of the mafia.
There can be moments of hope and redemption, especially in Adam's growing relationship with Zoe/Lilith.
Setting Description:

Describe the orange desert in vivid detail, highlighting its beauty and danger.
In the urban city setting, focus on the rundown and dangerous aspects of the city, such as the seedy neighborhoods and clubs where the mafia operates.
Conflict:

The main conflict is Adam's struggle to regain control of his life and find redemption, while also navigating the dangerous world of the mafia.
The conflict with the snake boss and his goons creates tension and danger throughout the story.
Adam's relationship with Zoe/Lilith is also a source of conflict as he tries to reconcile his feelings for her with her involvement in the mafia.
Themes:

Themes include redemption, the cost of power, the dangers of the criminal underworld, and the power of love and loyalty.
Other potential themes could include identity, transformation, and sacrifice.
Dialogue:

Dialogue should be natural and fitting for each character's personality and background.
Use dialogue to reveal information about the characters and advance the plot.
Pay attention to the dialogue in action scenes to keep the reader engaged and invested in what is happening.
Plot Development:

Start the story with Adam waking up in his new body and introduce the conflict with the snake boss and his organization.

Build the tension as the conflict with the snake boss and his goons escalates.
In the final showdown, Adam and his allies face off against the snake boss and his goons, with Zoe/Lilith caught in the middle. The resolution should be satisfying but leave room for future stories in the series.
