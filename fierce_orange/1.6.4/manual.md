    Orange Fierce chronicles 1.64

    THE STORY BEFORE THE STORY - in bullets.

    this is a story about a man named Adam, and Lilith his ex assassin.
    Can you fall in love with your captor? Can you crave in dark lust your own narcissi’s nemesis? I guess this is unavoidable on many levels.
    To one such a man it truly happened, maybe it was because of his codependent naive and trusting nature, or perhaps it was indeed the peculiar fact that this man has been born again inside his own skin - this leads to blind trust.
    Lilith on the other hand has always been a victim, of herself and of her consequences… from her young hopeless age she always spearheaded her way into everything.
    Growing up as an orphan with potential she was recruited from a young age by a secret organization “the cloak” this governament funded facility is training young agents as to balance the influx of Russian spies that had similar capacities.
    Lilith were assigned to case 142.857-Ni on August the 28th of 1978, this high volume of a case was mainly revolved around the surveillance of Adam, a brilliant astrophysics that out of sheer genius and part luck had also shamanic affairs.
    What were Adam;s inventions / discoveries and what made him such a high mark target?
    It all began when Adam was much younger, his interests in the true nature of numbers had led his path to explore the nature of numbers at the very core, according to certain branches of mathematics the invention of 0 came much after the 9 numbers - Adam’s mind as a great explorer never gave rest to fundamental questions, and while excelling above his other colleagues and by the use of his father’s heavy trust fund not only he finished high school at the age of 14 proceeding into his academic thesis, he also developed a much wilder side.
    Adam’s wilder side drew him to explore ancient myths which involved magic, he came upon some teachings that revolved around dimensions, shamanic voyages and the nature of games - he mainly studied the symbolic connection between tarot, the numbers hidden in the ancient Hebraic language and the shamanic rituals, upon the age of 18 he took his first hyuasca, an ancient shamanic ritual, which not only flooded his nose with black powder but also left his bloodstream completely poisoned with hallucinogenic substances.
    Returning from the dreaming world he underwent a voyage in which his sense were denied from his use, first his sight, then his touch, his journey took him to the point of his own death - an encounter with a deadly sea fish.
    By the age of 20 Adam not only excelled in anything he did mainly in thanks to the constant support of his loving parents but also in part due to a new mechanism he started to develop after doing some research into Russian gurus mainly Gurdjieff that he researched after realizing he also made a foundation revolving the numbers without the zero addition.
    Then the studies around the zero began and Adam found the darkest deepest of holes - a portal to another dimension? A loophole? He couldn’t quite explain.
    So Adam’s theory grew in length and in importance, in fact the governament had a huge red file in the realm of the occult - preventing any real science in that field since most power structures of modern society were in need of the old paradigms - from religion to healthcare - they had to put a lid on this growing chaos- if too many people will be influenced by tarot, numerology and the understanding that the body is a whole mechanism - that will undermine all systems of control.
    Such is the conspiracy, but in reality the “cloack” had utilized precisely such arts with a dark twist - that is the main reason Adam was their prime target.
    Lilith were matched to do surveillance on Adam 24/7, she has been his shaddow for quite some time before making first contact, and once done it was like a moth to a flame.
    Adam never married Lilith, it is just a tale fabricated, also Lilith didn’t mean to pull that trigger, at least not to squeeze it so tightly or hit so accurately.

    RECAP

    Black gold 1.6.4

    Adam spent 3 years in coma, during which he had many voyages mainly he witnessed his own birth along with that of the universe- he partook in a multidimensional paradoxical creation in which the sun lies at the core of all beings and acts as both nurising source of life and a portal to the unknown.

    After some passages between the realms of reality and fantasy Adam begins to regain his body and earth senses - at this point the hospital staff although of professional agents is slightly terrorized by a chain of peculiar events - ranging from spontaneous fires or corridor floods to glass shattering police lines and the repeated sound of a single gunshot at the middle of the night.

    Also Adam experiences some of thos flashbacks - his bed flies in space yet it is underwater, he lies on it in deep coma connected to lifelines and is surrounded by green beeping monitors - in outer space, his hospital bed is navigating the milky way, falls into the depths of the ocean and crashes into the hospital itself.

    And then, slowly but surely Adam starts to shift…

    Upon meeting this conjunction plexus Adam decides to return to earth and to solve his life in the correct manner, however a new soul gets transported right back to it’s original body, this new soul enters the old host vessel without prior knowledge - therefore it can no longer function as a brilliant scientist.

    Adam is awakening.

    Since the new Adam remembers that life is just an illusion and he is open to experience life in totality he surprises his captors with his newfound lust for life.

    TRIBALRED 1.6.4

    Lilith reveals to us her part in the tale, from an ex assassin that only pretended to be married to Adam she starts to get curious with this weird case of a man - for starters he is nothing like the old codependent being he once was - if it weren’t for the same face, that same tone of speech and even the way he walks she could swear that this is a completely different man.

    To her astonishment she is also sexually aroused by him, and this is mighty bizarre since after many many sexual encounters she hasn’t felt this way in many years. To anyone - for her the sexual body is just another tool to manipulate man and get what she wants.

    And Adam as well is drawn to her - it is not for her external appearance and appealing body for his senses are constantly alerting him that she is a viper he should do his best to avoid.

    But he cannot escape this massive flame of desire- he is drawn to her and at nights he plunges in highly sensual fantasies

    Adam is transported back to his home - he doesn’t recognize any of it - a desolate villa in a secluded forest, Adam looks at the marriage album and photos of friends but he doesn’t recognize anyone, not from the few visitors that come to him and claim to know him, not even to Lilith who claims to know hi from before - she tells him lies about their mutual life, his position at the faculty - his research - he recalls none of it - and how could he- for he is a different man altogether.

    The deep sensual dreams are mutual- each night they caress and kiss and curl with each other for warmth and solace - but come morning they act like stranger, a weird silence and tension is rising - the casual glance shows them that this is indeed mutual - which even increases the arousal and curiosity.

    The dreams are getting stronger each night, more vivid and Adam finds himself longing for Lilith’s embrace, the touch of her hair on his skin, her lips as she bites down on him vigorously…
